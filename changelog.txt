Changelog for datRPG

8/23/16: Project started by Dane and Gibson, with Dane giving it the really dumb name of datRPG, which has stuck and will stick until we can make a better name.

We have created and implemented basic stats and fighting system + basic text to action (tta) interpreter, unfinished.
